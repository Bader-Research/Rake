# Rake: Parallel Expression Evaluation using Tree Contraction

This parallel code (a SIMPLE/SMP module) evaluates arithmetic
expression trees using the algorithmic techniques of list ranking and
tree contraction; this problem is not only of interest in its own
right, but is representative of a large class of irregular
combinatorial problems that have simple and efficient sequential
implementations and fast PRAM algorithms, but have no known efficient
parallel implementations.
